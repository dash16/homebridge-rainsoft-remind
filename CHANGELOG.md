## v0.3.1 ‚Äî ‚ÄúPlatform, Meet Accessory‚Äù
**Release Date:** 2025-10-30

### üß© Summary
This stabilization patch converts the plugin from a mis-declared *platform* into a properly registered *accessory*, resolving child-bridge startup failures and blank Home.app behavior after v0.3.0.  
It also removes EC5-specific naming and clarifies configuration schema alignment.

### ‚ú® Changes
- ‚úÖ Fixed **plugin type mismatch** (`platform` ‚Üí `accessory`) to restore pairing and child-bridge reliability.
- ‚úÖ Standardized `pluginAlias` ‚Üí `RainsoftRemind` (consistent casing with `index.js`).
- ‚úÖ Updated default accessory name and model label to generic *RainSoft System*.
- ‚úÖ Cleaned up logging and UI schema wording.
- ‚úÖ Clarified `README.md` instructions to reflect accessory configuration.
- ‚úÖ Bumped version to **0.3.1** and polished package metadata (keywords, description).

### üß∞ Developer Notes
- Re-add the plugin as an *accessory* (not a platform) in Homebridge UI.
- If a broken child bridge exists from 0.3.0, remove it and restart Homebridge.
- Future versions will build on this as the **stable baseline** for new features.

# v0.3.0 ‚Äî Autodiscovery
**Release Date:** 2025-10-27

### ‚ú® New Features
- **Automatic Login & Discovery** ‚Äì The plugin now authenticates directly with the RainSoft Remind API using your email and password. No more manual tokens or Charles Proxy snooping required.
- **Device ID Resolution** ‚Äì Automatically finds your connected EC5 system and links it to HomeKit.  
	- Read-only Fields ‚Äì Detects model, serial, and device ID and displays in the UI but protected from editing.
	- Simplified Configuration ‚Äì Only email, password, and (optionally) polling interval are needed in your Homebridge config.
- **Live Polling** ‚Äì Retrieves fresh device data on a configurable schedule. Defaults to a safe 30-minute interval to reduce API load.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Improvements
- Refactored discovery logic into modular helper functions.
- Better handling of API timeouts and token refreshes.
- **New Homebridge UI schema** ‚Äì The plugin is now recognized as a platform, with a clear, modern configuration layout.

### üßπ Internal
- **Power User Mode** ‚Äì Added a collapsible ‚ÄúPower Users / Manual Setup‚Äù section that allows specifying authToken and deviceId manually for advanced or offline setups.
- Removed legacy token and manual device ID fields.
- Streamlined `index.js` and `RainsoftAPI.js` for maintainability.
- Updated README with new setup instructions and visuals.
- Removed Herobrine.
